# ShopMaster CLI

A modular **command-line application** built in **pure PHP 8.3**, designed to manage products, orders, payments, and inventory — **without any framework**.

This project demonstrates strong understanding of **OOP**, **software architecture**, and **domain-driven design principles** in a clean, framework-independent environment.

---

## Features

- Modular architecture (Product, Order, Customer, Payment, Delivery)
- Layered design: Controller → Service → Repository → Model
- Custom Dependency Injection (no framework)
- Exception-based error handling
- Data persistence via JSON files (no database)
- Input validation and domain rules
- PSR-4 autoloading (Composer)
